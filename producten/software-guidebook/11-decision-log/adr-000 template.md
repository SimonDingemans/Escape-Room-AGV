### ADR-002 TITLE

Datum: 2025-03-21

> [!TIP]
> These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, "ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10" or "ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration". The whole ADR should be one or two pages long. We will write each ADR as if it is a conversation with a future developer. This requires good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs. Bullets are acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments. (Bullets kill people, even PowerPoint bullets.)

#### Status

> [!TIP]
> A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

#### Context

> [!TIP]
> This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts about the problem we're facing and points out factors to take into account or to weigh when making the final decision.

#### Afgewogen opties

> [!TIP]
> This section mentions the possible options as headers in the second, third, etc. column. The forces in the left column are criteria (requirements, quality attributes, other forces like costs, learning curve, cultural, political or ethical factors that we can use to make the decision.
